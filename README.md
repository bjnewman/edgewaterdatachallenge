This is a project that originated from a coding challenge to analyze the Chicago Crime dataset at https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2

I started with the idea that mapping the latest crimes would be an interesting visualization. Currently this maps the latest 1000 crimes but I would like to give users the option to display different numbers of crimes or to select to map reported crimes based on a date range.
