This is a project that originated from a coding challenge to analyze the Chicago Crime dataset at https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2

I started with the idea that mapping the latest crimes would be an interesting visualization. Check out the map to see a geographic plot of recent crime in Chicago.

Next I focused on a few simple data cuts that highlight some easy to understand data. I explain the shortcomings of the limited analysis in the about section.
